## Description

A simple employee directory. The app was created using React, axios, and randomuser API for collecting dummy data. A random selection of 50 employees is populated upon the first page load. Users can view the names, emails and profile pictures of each employee and search employees by first or last name.

The application was deployed using Heroku: https://desolate-tundra-52266.herokuapp.com/
